      <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence
        exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of
        research in computer science that develops and studies methods and
        software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use
        learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of
        achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines
        (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon,
        and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant,
        Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and
        creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and
        superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).
        However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting
        edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being
        called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough
        it's not labeled AI anymore."[2][3]
      </p>
      <p>
        The various subfields of AI research are centered around particular
        goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI
        research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning,
        learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for
        robotics.[a] General intelligence—the ability to complete any task
        performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's
        long-term goals.[4] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted
        and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and
        mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and
        methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI
        also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and
        other fields.[5]
      </p>

      <p>
        Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in
        1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[7][8]
        followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI
        winter.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when
        deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth
        accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture,[12]
        and by the 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in
        AI (known as the "AI boom"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st
        century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present
        and raised concerns about its risks and the long-term effects in the
        future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the
        safety and benefits of the technology
      </p>
      <p>
        Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step
        reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical
        deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for
        dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts
        from probability and economics.[14]
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning
        problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They
        become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely
        use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They
        solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16]
        Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain
        and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation
        and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions
        intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal
        knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and
        retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20]
        knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from
        large databases),[21] and other areas.[22]
      </p>

      <p>
        A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can
        be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations,
        concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23]
        Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties,
        categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events,
        states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge
        (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning
        (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and
        will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other
        aspects and domains of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the
        breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the
        average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most
        commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as
        "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).[16] There is
        also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining
        knowledge for AI applications.[c]
